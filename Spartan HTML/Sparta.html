<h2><center>Something Different</center></h2>
<font face="Cursive">
Sparta, also known as Lacedaemon, was an ancient Greek city-state located primarily in the present-day region of southern Greece called Laconia. The population of Sparta consisted of three main groups: the Spartans, or Spartiates, who were full citizens; the Helots or serfs, which are slaves; and the Perioeci, who were neither slaves nor citizens. The Perioeci, whose name means "dwellers-around," worked as craftsmen and traders, and built weapons for the Spartans.  
All healthy male Spartan citizens participated in the compulsory state-sponsored education system, the Agoge, which emphasized obedience, endurance, courage and self-control. Spartan men devoted their lives to military service, and lived communally well into adulthood. A Spartan was taught that loyalty to the state came before everything else, including one's family. 
The Helots, whose name means "captives," were fellow Greeks, originally from Laconia and Messenia, who had been conquered by the Spartans and turned into slaves. The Spartans' way of life would not have been possible without the Helots, who handled all the day-to-day tasks and unskilled labor required to keep society functioning: They were farmers, domestic servants, nurses and military attendants.
Spartans, who were outnumbered by the Helots, often treated them brutally and oppressively in an effort to prevent uprisings. Spartans would humiliate the Helots by doing such things as forcing them to get debilitating drunk on wine and then make fools of themselves in public. (This practice was also intended to demonstrate to young people how an adult Spartan should never act, as self-control was a prized trait.) Methods of mistreatment could be far more extreme: Spartans were allowed to kill Helots for being too smart or too fit, among other reasons.
<h2><center>Life in Sparta</center></h2>
From the moment of a Spartan girl or a boy came into the world, the military and the city state were the center of every Spartan citizen's life. Both male and female babies were determined by city state if they were strong enough to be Spartan citizens. If the infants were too week or sick, they were abandoned in the country side to die. This was a very common thing in the Greek world because Sparta made it an official government policy. When a male Spartan was at the age of seven, he was taken from his mother and sent to live in special military barracks for twenty three years. In these barracks they were taught discipline, athletics, survival skills, hunting, weapons training and how to endure the pain. At the age of twenty in the barracks, the male Spartans become soldiers for the state. The life of a Spartan soldier was with his soldiers. He ate, slept and trained with them. They were allowed to marry, but couldn't live with their wives. Only equals were allowed to live with their wives and children. Equals were the soldiers who reached thirtieth age, but if any soldier who disgraced himself in any way was risked not becoming an equal. They were granted expanded rights and allowed to participate in politics. However equals were still soldiers. Military service was required until age sixty.
<p>
However this soldier centered state was the most liberal state in regards to the status of women. While women didn't go through military training, they were required to be educated along similar lines. The Spartans were the only Greeks not only to take seriously the education of women; they instituted it as state policy. This was not, however, an academic education (just as the education of males was not an academic education); it was a physical education which could be grueling. Infant girls were also exposed to die if they were judged to be weak; they were later subject to physical and gymnastics training. This education also involved teaching women that their lives should be dedicated to the state. In most Greek states, women were required to stay indoors at all times (though only the upper classes could afford to observe this custom); Spartan women, however, were free to move out and had an unusual amount of domestic freedom for their husbands, after all, didn't live at home.
<p>
Spartan society was dived into three main classes. At the top was Spartiate, or native Spartan, who could trace his or her ancestry back to the original inhabitants of the city. The Spartiate served in the army and was the only person who enjoyed the full political and legal rights of the state. Below the Spartiates were the perioeci (dwellers around and about). These were foreign people who served as a kind of buffer population between the Spartans and the helots. Because of this vital function, they were accorded a great deal of freedom. Most of the trade and commerce carried out in Sparta were performed by the perioeci. At the bottom, of course, were the helots.  Spartan government was an odd affair, but its overwhelming characteristic was stability. The Spartans, in fact, had the most stable government in the history of ancient Greece (some historian call this stability, "political stagnation"). At the top of the government was the monarchy; the monarchy, however was a dual monarchy. Below the monarchy was a council which was composed of the two kings plus twenty eight nobles, all of whom were over sixty, that is retired from the military.
<p>
The council debated and set legislative and foreign policy, and was the supreme criminal court. Below the council was democracy of all the Spartiate males that selected the council and vetoed or approved proposals. Above them all, however, was a small group of five men known as the ephorate. For all practical purposes, Spartan government was the emphorate, for these five men led the council,ran the educational system, ran the military, ran the infant selection system and had veto power on everything coming out of the assembly or council. They even had power on king to depose; however, they needed powerful divine proof to exercise this power. So Spartan state was a democratic, timocratic, (Timocracy is a state in which the love of honor is the ruling motive) monarchical, oligarchy.
<p>
The helot's anxiety ridden situation led the Spartans to fear even their neighbors, who were often sticking their spoons in that pot to brew up trouble. So the Spartans started to set their military sights on neighboring states in the sixth century B.C. However, when they conquered their neighbor, Tegea, rather than annex their land and people, they set up a truce with them. They demanded an alliance. This was a brilliant move on the part of Spartans. Because Tegea would follow Sparta in all its foreign relationships, including wars, and also would supply for Sparta with a fixed amount of soldiers and equipments.  Tegea would remain an independent state in the exchange. In the southern part of Greece Sparta had formed with a huge number of states in a short time and had become the major power in Greece when the Persians invaded in 490 B.C. Their power eclipsed that of even their powerful neighbor in the north, Athens.

<h2><center>Spartan Military Decline</center></h2>
After the Pelopensian War Spartan military dominance was challenged by Thebes, with the Aid of Athens, Corinth and Argos in the Corinthian War (395-387 BC). Although Sparta was able to achieve a number of land victories but was weekend by raiding on its Coast and provoking the helots to revolt. However after a short truce the war again flared up in an all-out battle for supremacy. The Spartans were defeated in the Battle of Lauctra by the great general and strategist Epaminondas of Thebes. His tactic of using and echelon formation with the leading side loaded up with his best troops and in very deep formation allowed him to break the unbreakable, the Spartan hoplite line crumbled.
<p>
The Spartans had lost up to 4000 hoplites and the helots revolted, a one two punch they would never recover from as Spartan citizenship was dependant on blood lines and there was no way to quickly regain manpower in their rigid society. The Spartan military had entered its long slow decline, eventualy their once cutting edge ancient weapons and tactics were even eclipsed. Nonetheless, Sparta was able to continue as a regional power for another two centuries. Neither Philip II nor his son Alexander the Great attempted to conquer Sparta itself respecting Spartan martial skill and not wanting to risk potentially high losses. It was reported that as late as 378 AD, following the disastrous defeat of the Roman imperial army at the Battle of Adrianople that a Spartan militia organized a phalanx and defeated a force of raiding Goths in battle.

<h2><center>Sparta's Military Legacy</center></h2>
Spartan warriors have been inspired many throughout history. Admiration for the Spartans even has a name, Laconophilia. Their actions at the Battle of Thermopylae in particular have a place in the modern culture and it is perhaps the most famous last stand in history. The story about how 300 Spartans (and 700 Thespiae, who are often neglected) defended the pass at Thermopylae for 3 days against what against a massive Persian army (2 million according to Herodotus, although probably around 70,000 - 300,000 by modern estimations) has been told countless times. Modern interpretations of the Spartans have typically whitewashed some of their more brutal intuitions and portrayed them as the saviors of Western culture. This honorific, if applied to them along with the other Greek States, is not entirely undeserved though as Greek culture would become the bases for Western culture. A Persian victory over the Greeks would certainly have extinguished this light, along with ideas such as democracy, philosophy and science.
