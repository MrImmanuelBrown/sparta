<h2><center>Spartan Accomplishments</center></h2>

A common assumption that Sparta lacked artistic achievements is incorrect. When Pausanias was traveling through Sparta in the second century AD, he recorded hundreds of significant buildings, temples, monuments, tombs, and public buildings that were part and parcel of Spartan art and culture. According to contemporary sources, Sparta was particularly renowned for its music and dance. Spartan sculptor’s creations were active and helped in pan-European sites such as Delphi and Olympia. Spartan bronze works were coveted as gifts and imports. Spartan poets were admired throughout the ancient world and it was one of these who wrote the first recorded heterosexual love poems known today.

<h2><center>Architectural Monuments</center></h2>

Looking first at architecture, Sparta was distinguished by its early democracy and prosperity, and by the fact that it was unconquered and unplundered until relatively late in ancient times.  In short, its monuments were built early and there was no compulsion to replace them. (We should not forget that the splendor of the Athenian Acropolis is largely a function of the fact that the Persians destroyed all the older temples on the site.  As a result, Pericles was able to carry out a comprehensive modernization of the entire Acropolis at the very pinnacle of Athenian power, wealth, and artistic prominence.) 

<p>

Sparta did have buildings and temples, however, that were greatly admired in their own time. The most significant of these were the Menelaion and the Amyklaion.  The Menelaion, which dates from roughly 700 BC, was erected as a monument or temple to Menelaos and Helen.  It is located near the remains of a Mycenaean palace – allegedly the palace of Menelaos – dating roughly from the 15th century BC.  The Amyklaion was admired by ancient historians as the most significant temple in all Lacedaemon.  It was built in Sparta's Golden Age – the 6th century BC.  This temple contained a massive bronze statue of Apollo surrounded by colonnades and stoa.  Particularly worthy of mention is also the Spartan Assembly Hall, a monumental stoa built in the mid-6th century and greatly admired by visitors to Sparta.  The Persian Stoa, built after the victory over the Persians in the 5th century, was later added as a counterpart on the agora and was also significant. In short, the city of Sparta had a rich, varied, and yet urban character – despite the disparaging remarks made by Thucydides. 

<h2><center>Sculpture and Crafts in Bronze, Ivory, and Terra Cotta</center></h2>

 There is now significant archaeological as well as historical evidence that Sparta enjoyed an artistic Golden Age from roughly 650 to 550 BC.  In this period, its artistic achievements were renowned throughout the known world.  At this time, Spartan sculptors were active not only at home but also in cultural centers such as Olympia and Delphi; at least nine sculptors are known by name.  Spartan bronze products were of such high quality that they were viewed as valuable diplomatic gifts and found their way to the far corners of the earth.  Laconian pottery was, for a period of roughly 100 years, sufficiently valued to be a significant export commodity. Beautiful examples of Laconian pottery still exist, providing sufficient evidence of the very high quality of both the pottery and the painting – even if classical Corinthian and Athenian vases and painting demonstrate a yet higher quality a century later.  Laconian ivory work was another export product, reflecting the high quality of the craftsmen. 

<h2><center>Poetry, Music, and Dance</center></h2>

 Without doubt, Sparta was most renowned in its own time for its poetry, music, and dance.  We know of four Spartan poets and lyricists whose works were admired throughout the ancient world, although only fragments of their work have survived the centuries.  We know that people traveled great distances to witness the choral and dance contests of the Spartans at their various festivals, particularly the Gymnopaedia and the Hyakinthia.  It is also recorded that the Spartans advanced into battle singing.  Yet, as with all ancient Greek music and dance, nothing remains for the modern observer to grasp. It is left to our imagination.

<h2><center>Spartan Women</center><h2>

Spartan women had a reputation for being independent-minded, and enjoyed more freedoms and power than their counterparts throughout ancient Greece. While they played no role in the military, female Spartans often received a formal education, although separate from boys and not at boarding schools. Here they learned wrestling, gymnastics, were taught to fight, and endured other physical training. Spartans believed that strong mothers produced strong children. Young women competed at athletic events and may have competed in the nude as the men did. If they passed their citizen tests, they were assigned a husband. Marriage was important to Spartans, as the state put pressure on people to have male children who would grow up to become citizen-warriors, and replace those who died in battle. Since they were not allowed to become married until they were 18-20, they were more emotionally mature when they married and closer to the age of their husbands. Marrying later than other Greek women, the Spartan women produced stronger children, if not as many. To prepare for the wedding night, her hair was cut short and she was dressed in male clothing. The man then returned to his all-male barracks.

Men and women did not live together, but met occasionally for procreation. The wedding consisted of a ritualized physical struggle which resulted in the man slinging the woman over his shoulder and taking her off. By the end of the 4th century BCE there were more women than men in Sparta and women often had more than one father for their children, and it’s possible that several men might share a wife. Connubial love was discouraged by the city-state, but there is evidence that some husbands and wives loved each other very much. This fact would embarrass them if it were known, a shameful weakness, so such attachments were usually kept secret.

<p>

Women enjoyed much greater freedom and independence in Sparta than in other Greek city-states. Because mothers had little responsibility for the care of their children, they were not as tied to the home as most Greek women were. They were allowed to walk abroad in the city and transact their own affairs. They owned their own property, as much as a third of the property in Sparta. Their husbands were only a minor part of their lives, and except in matters relating to the military were generally their own masters.

<p>

They were not as close to their children as other Greek women in some ways, but a mother had pride in her son's stature as a courageous and strong soldier. “Come home with your shield or upon it” was said to be the advice one woman gave her son as he went off to war. They shared the culture's shame of weakness. Although the Spartans did not have a family life as we think of it, there is evidence that in some cases at least Spartan men and women had close ties to their children and with each other. Their system certainly was well-ordered and avoided the "moral degeneration" they despised in the Athenians who they saw as wallowing in luxuries. And there is no doubt that the system produced strong soldiers. The Spartan army was legendary in ancient Greece, and the legend continues to this day.
