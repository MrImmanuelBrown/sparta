Decided to teach myself something new.

This repo will contain an HTML webpage that was a class project from High School I believe I have the picture somewhere. *shrugs*

Hopefully this works first try if it doesn't I'll be sure to record the journey.

Was unable to figure out how to add the repo using only Atom
installed GitHub Desktop and then BOOM! I had a signin option on Atom
